<br>
<div>Abstract: Domestic violence (DV) is a crime that usually has female victims and is often under
reported. This paper studies the effect of having a female officer dispatched in the primary unit
 on the discovery of DV in physical abuse incidents in Milwaukee and Chicago. Using three-year
 calls for service data and conditional random assignment of officers in the dispatch process, the
 paper finds that the existence of a female officer in the primary unit scales up the likelihood of
 discovering DV in physical abuse incidents by 10% in Milwaukee. Analysis of data from Chicago
 indicates a similar effect. These results indicate that female officers play an important role in
 discovering DV.</div>

<h3>College Basketball Game Day and Sexual Assault (with Dingyue Liu, Working Paper)</h3>
<div>Abstract: Basketball games are an important part of college identity and social activities. This
 paper studies the effect of college basketball game days on the probability of having local sexual
 assault reports. Using crime data from universities with top basketball programs and local law
enforcement agencies, this paper shows that home game days have little effect on the probability
 of sexual assault reports, while away game days scale up the probability by 14%. This finding is
 different from those found for football, which likely reflects differences in viewing and partying
 behavior across the two sports.</div>

<h3>School Lunch and Nutrition (Working Paper)</h3>
<div> Abstract: School lunch is an important channel of studentsâ€™ nutrition intake. This paper studies
 the potential mechanisms for effects of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act using metabolic
 analysis. Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, the paper
 finds that this policy decreased the probability of having high total cholesterol by about 30% for
 students who usually eat school lunches. This result is largely driven by the significant decrease
 in the proportion of students with high LDL cholesterol and triglycerides. The results reported
 in the paper show the powerful impact of this policy on adolescent health.</div>

<h3>Weather Modification and Local Climate Management in the United States: A
 Review of Its Technological Evolution, Operations, Governance, and Local Imple
mentation Challenges (with Haoying Wang, Working Paper, Submitted at <i>Climate</i>)</h3>
<div> Abstract: Weather modification has gained significant and growing interest in the United States
 (US) in recent years. The trend can be largely attributed to the changing climate, persistent
 droughts, and other extreme weather events that have been experienced across various regions
 of the US. This paper provides a critical review of weather modification program costs, benefits,
 and governance to help shed light on policymaking and program management associated with
 the growing interest in adopting weather modification as a local climate management strategy in
 the US. Additionally, to deepen our understanding of the widely concerning issues, such as the
 financial burden on taxpayers and potential environmental risks, the paper explored the local
 implementation challenges and common environmental and health concerns related to weather
 modification activities. A synthesis of literature and policy debates suggests three general conclusions: (1) The need for weather modification programs is expected to keep growing, though
 regional variations may exist due to regulatory and other local factors; (2) state-level and local support, including financial resources, will be important for program development in the
 foreseeable future; and (3) technological advancements will be critical for addressing many of
 the project operation efficiency challenges and environmental and public health concerns related to weather modification programs. More specifically for program governance and local
 implementation, aspects such as project planning (including resource pooling), risk and liability
 management, communication and reporting, outcome measurability, and stakeholder engage
ment are indispensable for addressing issues related to program legality, public acceptance, and
 sustainability. </div>
